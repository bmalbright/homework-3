# homework-3

Homework 3 was to build a random password generator that included options for upper and lower case letters as well as numbers and symbols. I made the lower case letters the default character to be used in all passwords, and added the upper case letters, numbers, and symbols as desired. 

There is only the intial commit and the final commit on this because there wasn't much to commit in between. I needed to catch up on studying after the last homework, and so it spent a couple of days researching and grasping concepts before writing anything. Today was just a long session of more research and then writing the code, and there wasn't obvious stopping points where it seemed necessary to commit. 

I did study sessions with Alex, Jayla, Stephanie, and a few others. I saw only a little code and any similarities were already there. The big help came from Ethan. He walked me through the concepts I couldn't fully grasp and help me connect dots to others I understood in isolation. I didn't see his code at all, but he walked me through mine. 

I basically defined the variables. Asked for password length, and combined arrays as options were added. 

I did change a little wording in html to make the button function clearer. I also changed the background color in the css just to give it a little variation. Lemonchiffon is really stylish. Kind of like the new black.
